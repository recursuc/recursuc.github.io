This example shows how to arrange timetable and save table content to the MySQL database.
Database communication is written inside config.php which is included in index.php and db_save.php

Inside ajax directory is AJAX variant of this demo without features like printing subjects or spreading
school objects across week.

Before start using this demo you should:
1) create two tables: redips_subject and redips_timetable (see database.sql)
2) define database name, user name and password in config.php

After these steps are finished, empty timetable should appear and you can start drag school subjects.

Happy dragging and dropping!
